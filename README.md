# How to Run

Sorry, I only saw the SSR at the very end of the email when I was reviewing the project. I had already written the FE and BE and spent an hour researching ways of getting my frontend to be server-side-rendered. If this disqualifies me for this opportunity, so be it.

## How to run

Go to root of the directory and `docker-compose up`

## App

App is available at `http://localhost:3000/`, I didn't make an operation for generating users, but you can just tap the Generate a New User button to keep generating new users, the pagination should update along with that.
Click any user and you'll be sent to their page.

## Nestjs

I saw that the backend request was to use Node.js so I decided to use a framework on top of Node called Nestjs, made development really easy.

## React, Tailwind, ShadCn

I wanted to experiment with ShadCN, since it's a new way of handling component libraries
